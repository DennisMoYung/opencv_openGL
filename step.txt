1. Multiple Camera Calibration
Steps:
Calibrate each camera individually using the method described earlier (checkerboard images, detecting corners, cv.calibrateCamera).
Store the calibration parameters (camera matrix, distortion coefficients) for each camera.

2. Capture Synchronized Images from All Cameras
You need to capture images from all cameras simultaneously. This is crucial for creating a consistent panorama.
Steps:
Set up a system to trigger all cameras at the same moment.
Ensure good overlap between the fields of view of adjacent cameras.

3. Image Stitching
Stitching involves aligning and combining images from multiple cameras into a single panorama.
Steps:
Feature Detection & Matching: Use algorithms like SIFT or SURF on each image to find and match features across images from different cameras.
Estimating Homography: Compute the homography matrices for pairs of images using matched features.
Warping and Blending: Warp images using homography matrices so they align correctly. Blend the images together seamlessly.

Code Concepts:
Use OpenCV functions like cv.warpPerspective for warping.
Apply multi-band blending for smooth transitions.

4. Cube Mapping for 360-Degree View
Cube mapping projects the panorama onto a cube, which is then used to render the 360-degree view.

Steps:
Convert the stitched panorama into six square faces of a cube.
Each face corresponds to a direction: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.

Code Concepts:
You might use OpenGL or another 3D graphics library for cube map generation and rendering.
Map the stitched images onto the cube's faces and render it in a 360-degree view format.

5. Assembling the 360-Degree Panorama
Finally, assemble these cube faces to create a 360-degree interactive panorama.

Steps:
Use a viewer that can interpret and navigate through the cube map. This could be a custom viewer or a pre-existing solution.
Implement user interaction for navigating through the panorama (pan, tilt, zoom).

Additional Considerations:
Real-Time Processing: If you aim for a real-time application, significant optimization and powerful hardware (like GPUs) may be required.
Seam Correction: Handle seams where images are joined, especially if there are moving objects or exposure differences.
Software Tools: Utilize libraries like OpenCV for image processing, OpenGL or Three.js for 3D rendering, and possibly Web technologies for online viewers.
